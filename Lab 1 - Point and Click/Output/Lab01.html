Lab 1 - Point and Click

<b>Made by:</b>
Diogo Muller


<b>Timeframe: </b>
October 8 - October 9, 2013


<b>Project Detail:</b>
Fast-paced point and click game, created using Unity and following the <a href="http://walkerboystudio.com/html/unity_course_lab_1.html">Walker Boys Studio lessons.</a>
Followed the tutorials with slight alterations - Used C# instead of JavaScript, so I had to make some changes.
Other changes include using Shuriken instead of the old particle system.
I also did all the "On Your Own" exercises and the Extra Credit exercise.


<b>Tools:</b>
This lab was made using Unity, with C# and MonoDevelop (Lab)/Visual Studio 2012 (On my own) as an editor.


<b>Final Thoughts:</b>
It was a pretty simple project, but fun nonetheless. It was my first contact with Unity, and it is simple enough to make something fast.
As someone who works with C# since 2006, I was pretty comfortable with the language. There are a few differences in the use of a few
classes and methods calls in JavaScript and C#. There where also some changes between the version of Unity used on the lessons and the
latest version avaliable, but nothing that a few web searches couldn't fix. The biggest difference was the particle system, but with a
few minutes of research it was pretty easy to mimic the lesson explosion particle, in the new particle system.
For the next labs, I'll still use C#. The differences may get bigger and bigger with time, but it's worth it for me.
This first game gave me a pretty good idea to what expect in the future, and I'm pumped to continue with the labs.
